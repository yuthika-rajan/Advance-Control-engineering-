rcognita: a framework for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithm development, testing, and simulation.
The framework offers a playground of ready presets consisting of agents (controllers) and environments (dynamical systems).
The core of the framework is ``regelum`` - a flexible universe of interconnected modules realizing a learn-in-the-loop concept, i.e., learning on the fly via data generated by the system.
A distinct feature of ``regelum`` is: the controllers and systems exist in the same universe, i.e., one can assemble a single preset combining both types of the said entities.
